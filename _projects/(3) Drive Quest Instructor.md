description: An app to help driving instructors evaluate their students similar to the DMV's style of testing. Comes with funny sounds to ease the tension. In this project, I was responsible for sound system, the route selection, the freeway selection, and some of the overall design. (NOTE:It seems like the page for this app is currently unavailable, however, proof of app contribution is available on request.)

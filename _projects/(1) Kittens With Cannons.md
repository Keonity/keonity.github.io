description: A story-driven RPG about cats fighting a war against an army of evil robots. I was responsible for the quest system along with the scripts in place for breaking objects so that they'll drop items. I also implemented chromatic abberation into the game and controller vibration. Currently, I'm contributing on the design and art side of the game in order to pave our team a path to continue developing this project while also improving my game design and pixel art skills. I mostly work on fleshing out the lore of the game through dialogue and quests and art assets.

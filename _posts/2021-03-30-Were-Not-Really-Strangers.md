## Program Overview

In this program which was a collaboration between me and another resident advisor(RA), I hosted a modified version of "we're not really strangers" that had questions relating to topics on DEI(diversity, equity, and inclusion). 

The program began with my partner and I establishing the program as a safe space for the topics that we will be exploring. We additionally changed everyone's name on Zoom to a "." in order to help facilitate participation in the conversation via anonymity. In order to set the atmosphere and get participants more comfortable with participating, we had a short introductory period where residents introduced themselves under anonymity to each other.  After this, we started by asking questions on the cards from the card game and we both answered before opening it up for audience participation. 

Eventually, we ran out of cards to go through so we debriefed the topics that we discussed with a few introspective questions such as "What question felt the most uncomfortable for you to answer? Why do you think that is?"

The program ended with my partner and I giving out the card set that we used in the game to participants.

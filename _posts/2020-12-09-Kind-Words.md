## Program Overview

In this program, participants were instructed to change their screen name on Zoom to something anonymous in order to allow all participants to share their problems anonymously. I presented on mental health and worked with participants to set ground rules in order to establish a safe space to open up about our difficulties at college during the COVID-19 pandemic. I also presented on the importance of having an outlet for your emotions. 

After this, the floor was open for anyone to speak on any mental health obstacles they have faced. This lasted approximately an hour before various items were raffled off that centered around mental health wellness. These items included an essential oil diffuser with oils and tea.

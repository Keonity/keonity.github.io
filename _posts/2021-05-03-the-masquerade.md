## Program Overview

This program began with me dropping off art supplies and face masks at each resident's apartment on May 3rd around 4 pm. The apartments and residents to give masks to was determined via a sign-up sheet that they had filled out beforehand by accessing it through a QR code on a flyer posted at Chapman Grand or a link that was emailed to them.

At 5 pm, all residents logged onto a Zoom meeting. I introduced myself and had everyone else introduce themselves. The program proceeded with all of us talking about anything with each other while decorating face masks. This part of the program served to build rapport between the RAs and residents while also allowing residents to express themselves artistically.

At 5:50 pm, I announced that the event would be ending soon but that residents should let their masks air-cure for at least 24 hours as per instructions and safety warnings on the fabric markers. I then drew two names out of the participants of the program and I gave away a blender and a bullet journal in order to promote physical and emotional wellness.

Finally, I kept the program supplies secure by going to each participant's apartment after the program in order to collect the fabric markers they used. If they needed extra time to finish their mask, I allowed for that and came back the next day in order to collect the supplies.

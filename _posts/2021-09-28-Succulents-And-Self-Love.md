## Program Overview

This program began in the Henley Hall second floor, east lounge. I set up the event by organizing art supplies such as paint markers as well as by organizing succulents for participants to easily access.

This program was more passive and allowed participants to drop into the lounge, pick a succulent they wanted, and decorate the pot that the succulent was held in. I encouraged participants to decorate their succulents based on their own identities. This had an aim of allowing participants to develop a better understanding of themselves as well as an understanding of their peers by talking with them. I did not run out of succulents by the end of the program, so I closed down the event at 8 pm by collecting all of the art materials, the remaining succulents, and putting them away.

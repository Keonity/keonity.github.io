## Program Overview

This program began in the Henley Hall second floor, east lounge. I set up the event by organizing food and drink supplies as well as art supplies. I organized coffee pods, creamer, tea, sugar, honey, hot chocolate, and more. I additionally cut out a large piece of paper, slightly larger than a bulletin board, and taped it onto the lounge wall in order to allow residents to add their recipes to it using provided art materials, creating a community menu.

This program served as a "welcome back for spring semester" program and allowed participants to drop in and make their drinks as they wished. As a result, there wasn't much of a formal introduction, as most participants joined in the middle of the event. It was intended to be largely social in order to help participants bond with each other. 

The program ended at approximately 8:45 pm, once all participants had left the program.

## Program Overview

This program began in the Henley Hall second floor, east lounge. I set up the event by organizing art supplies such as paper leaves and paint markers.

At approximately 7 pm, almost all participants had arrived and I started off the event by introducing myself and then having them introduce themselves as well. I then explained that the point of the event was to write down our goals and personalize decorations with them. The purpose of this was to help give participants a push in the right direction to achieving their goals. After this, the event officially kicked off with participants making the aforementioned leaf door decorations. Participants were able to come and go as they desired and the program ended at approximately 8 pm. At this time, I hosted an opportunity drawing for all of the participants and the winner received a bullet journal to help them work towards their goals.
